# Cypress-CSS-Cheat-Sheet

Cypress provides a powerful set of querying functions that you can use in combination with CSS selectors to locate elements. These functions include cy.get(), cy.contains(), and more.
While following Cypress's best practices, using data-* attributes to provide context to your selectors and keep them isolated from CSS or JavaScript changes is recommended. However, in cases where data-* attributes are not available or suitable, and you still want to utilize CSS, you can take advantage of the upcoming CSS locator strategy.
By effectively understanding and utilizing CSS selectors, you can enhance the precision and stability of your element targeting in Cypress tests.
